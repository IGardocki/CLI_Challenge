Welcome to the CLI challenge! By listing out this directory, you will see there are several directories. 

1. First, find the file called brrrrrt.txt and read its contents. Good luck!

2. Second, your goal is to find the file orca.txt and read its contents. Hint: orca.txt may not make sense, but we may have included a script to help you with that! Another hint: To use the aforementioned script, you may have to run the script while setting a certain environment variable! Good luck!
