# CLI_Challenge

## Welcome to the CLI Challenge, where you can demonstrate your knowledge of basic command line usage. 

*For mentors: Pair with your mentee to help them clone this repo. Once it is cloned, the exercises should be completed in the terminal (not using a code editor like VSCode)*

1. Make a new directory. Call it my_new_dir.

2. Change directories to my_new_dir. Make a new file called my_new_file.txt.

3. Print your present working directory.

4. Now for the fun part! 
- Navigate out to the startHere directory.
- Change directories into that directory.
- list out the files in that directory. Hint: There may be a README that will help you out!
