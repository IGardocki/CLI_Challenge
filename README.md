# CLI_Challenge

## Welcome to the CLI Challenge, where you can demonstrate your knowledge of basic command line usage.

_For mentors: Pair with your mentee to help them clone this repo. Once it is cloned, all except exercise 4 should be completed in the terminal (not using a code editor like VSCode)_

1. Make a new directory. Call it my_new_dir.

2. Change directories to my_new_dir. Make a new file called my_new_file.txt.

3. Print your present working directory.

4. Use VSCode (or your preferred text editor) to open your ~/.zshrc file. Set a new global environment variable called SQ_CC equal to "Blackjack". Close VSCode.

5. Open a new terminal and check that the environment variable SQ_CC is indeed "Blackjack".

6. Now for the fun part!

- Navigate out to the startHere directory.
- Change directories into that directory.
- list out the files in that directory. Hint: View the README for further instructions!
